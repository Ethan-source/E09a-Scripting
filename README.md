The purpose of this assignment was to familiarize ourselves with user interface and how to create lives and a score system in Godot for out game "Breakout". Through the creation of this game I have learned how to overlay text, how to get the text to appear after lives are lost, how to install a life system, as well as implement a scoring system.
